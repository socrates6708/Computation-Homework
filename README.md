HDR images
Modern cameras are unable to capture the full dynamic range of commonly encountered natural scenes. High-dynamic-range (HDR) photographs are generally achieved by capturing multiple standard-exposure images, often using exposure bracketing, and then merging them into a single HDR image. Also, to view the HDR image on an ordinary low-dynamic-range (LDR) display, tone mapping operation from HDR to LDR on images is required. In this assignment, you will implement the whole HDR photography flow, including imagebracketing, cameraresponsecalibration, whitebalance, and finally, tonemapping, to visualize your results.
#implementation
In this section, you will implement the algorithms for the whole HDR imaging flow. For each function youneedtoimplementinHDR functions.py,acorrespondingtestfunctionisprovidedintest HDR functions.py to help you check the correctness. You can develop your functions step by step with these unit tests to com- plete the whole HDR flow. In test HDR functions.py, argument TEST PAT SIZE can be assigned to either small of large. small stands for small test pattern size and large stands for large test pattern size. It is recommended to set TEST PAT SIZE small for quick debugging during implementation. However, you have to pass the unit test with TEST PAT SIZE large to get the full score in each part. And please do not modify original function IO. Otherwise, your implementation will be considered as incorrect. Note that for large pattern size, the bilateral filtering process may take longer time to complete. One test image, memorial, is provided in folder /TestImage. After passing all unit tests, you can execute HDR flow.py to run the whole HDR imaging flow.
